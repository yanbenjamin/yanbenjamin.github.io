                        <p id="teaching">I love teaching, and want to help make computer science education accessible and welcoming for everyone! At Stanford, I have the privilege of TAing in the CS198 program and teaching introductory programming (Python, JavaScript, C, Assembly languages), web applications, computer systems, and coding for social good.</p>
                        <p>My full teaching evaluations are <a href = "http://tinyurl.com/bbyan-cs-evals"  onMouseOver="this.style.color='#444'" onMouseOut="this.style.color='black'" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">linked here</a>, and you can find some below :)</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li class=spacedList>“Ben has been the best TA I've had out of all my CS classes; he truly cares about making sure students succeed and freely gives out his time in order to do so.”</li>
                            <li class=spacedList>“Compassionate, goes out of his way to help students, amazing. He literally was such a fantastic TA that he changed my entire perspective on this class.”</li>
                            <li class=spacedList>"Ben was the best section leader I've ever had in CS."</li>
                            <li class=spacedList>“He is an incredible teacher. Throughout the quarter he was very effective and taught the lecture material very well. It felt like he was a CS Professor, and his fun and charismatuc way of teaching really helped me throughout the quarter”</li>
                            <li class=spacedList>“Ben was such a phenomenal TA!!! His office hours were immensely helpful, and I have learned a great deal on how to debug and approach bugs from Ben! In addition, Ben was exceptionally talented at explaining lecture content and material that may have needed a brush-up or re-explaining. In addition, Ben's final review session was so awesome, and he explained concepts in a succinct yet detailed and comprehensive manner! Can't recommend Ben enough.”</li>
                            <li class=spacedList>“Ben literally saved me from falling behind, he is wonderful”</li>
                            <li class=spacedList>“He is kind, patient, extremely intelligent and articulate, and so passionate. Whether it was in lab, stepping through EVERY question in depth and helping us fully grasp what was happening - not minding staying overtime where we often kept him - or in office hours, helping us debug from the bottom up because he truly wanted to help us with our skills, Ben outshines every CS TA I have had and I am so grateful for him.”</li>
                            <li class=spacedList>“Ben did a terrific job of explaining concepts thoroughly. He was extremely encouraging, thoughtful, personable, and hands-down the best TA I've had!”</li>
                            <li class=spacedList>“Ben's lecture reviews during the labs were incredibly clear, helping me quickly identify and address any gaps in my understanding. His explanations during the lab sessions were also excellent—he guided us through concepts step by step, and I always left the lab with new skills and techniques. Additionally, Ben was extremely helpful during office hours; he is one of the most dedicated and supportive TAs I've ever encountered. I can't thank him enough for all his assistance!"</li>
                            <li class=spacedList>“I feel incredibly lucky to have had Ben for CS107. He was not only deeply intelligent and technically sharp, but also patient, encouraging, and consistently engaging. He had a real gift for explaining complicated concepts in a way that made them stick … and he had a way of making students feel seen and supported, especially when we were struggling.”</li>
                            <li class=spacedList>“I have no words to describe how much Ben helped us!! He is so kind and patient, and his slides were the most visual and informative. He puts so much time and effort into his slides, and his dedication to his students is unmatched.”</li>
                            <li class=spacedList>“Ben was such a great section leader!! I loved the slides which led us through section (both their aesthetics and content) and helped me understand concepts when I was behind … or when concepts were confusing. I did heap allocator mainly off of the content I learned in Ben’s section, so that shows how well his section instruction supplemented the content of the lectures.”</li>
                            <li class=spacedList>“I learned effective debugging from him. The GOAT.”</li>
                            <li class=spacedList>“We love Ben! He's always super engaging, motivating, and helpful!”</li>
                            <li class=spacedList>“Ben is terrific! His slides are top-tier, he's very approachable and knowledgeable”</li>
                            <li class=spacedList>"Ben was one of the kindest TAs I have ever interacted with at Stanford. His enthusiasm was infectious, and his positive tone could even be felt over online platforms like Ed and email. As a student, I was truly inspired to know that an instructor was so invested in our learning. Ben also produced the highest quality learning materials I have ever seen in a CS class -- his lab slides."</li>
                            <li class=spacedList>"Ben is one of, if not the best, TA I have ever had or seen. He's just absolutely amazing, and I'd guess that he stayed to help students for over a dozen hours more than his required time."</li>
                            <li class=spacedList>"Ben takes the effort to really understand each and every student so that he can best help them. He doesn't gloss over my questions or problems with vague answers, instead, Ben takes the time to really understand my situation and leaves only when he knows I have made progress in figuring out my problem, typically the progress is a lot! Not only that, Ben is super relatable and I feel the most comfortable asking him questions that I feel might be dumb."</li>
                            <li class=spacedList>"I attended his lab at a makeup and made it a point to attend his office hours. Ben is incredible and so kind and amazing"</li>
                            <li class=spacedList>"Ben was incredible at breaking down everything that was taught in the lectures. He was very good at pacing the lab and gave all of us reasonable time to work on everything without going over the time."</li>
                            <li class=spacedList>"His lecture recaps were extremely useful...and his responses on Ed and in class discussions were both extremely timely, thorough, and well-explained."</li>
                            <li class=spacedList>"I felt the need to talk about this instructor because he really put in the effort to support me and other students this quarter. I could tell he really enjoyed helping students and seeing us succeed. He wasn't my section leader however I had a few interactions with him over office hours throughout the quarter. His explanations are great, it felt like I was learning and solving problems on my own. He also is very encouraging, motivated me to keep working on CS"</li>
                            <li class=spacedList>“I love Ben - best TA with Ecy that I've had. He is super organised, but always brings in a lot of energy and explains super well. He is a great TA”</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li class=spacedList>“If you are taking it with Ben, you are SO LUCKY! Ben was not only amazing as an instructor, always caring for us, helping us, giving us his full attention, and being super clear in his teaching, but he was also super motivational as he spoke about his story, different paths we can take, and of how large the world of CS is.”</li>
                            <li class=spacedList>“BEN IS THE BEST TEACHER EVER. Like, no seriously. Ben has a way with words that makes the class very interesting.”</li>
                            <li class=spacedList>“Ben is an outstanding TA and Lecturer…It is an honor to be a student purely because of the amount of effort he puts into teaching this class. I've never seen such dedication, commitment and passion from a teacher/lecturer/professor until I took this class with Ben. I can see Ben becoming a very successful educator in the future and this feedback is a testament and manifestation to that goal.”</li>
                            <li class=spacedList>“Ben is absolutely amazing, and it is so cool to get the technical and social science perspectives on the impacts of AI and programming. It is a low-stakes class and I cannot stress enough how wonderful and kind Ben is.”</li>
                            <li class=spacedList>“Ben was an amazing instructor, I feel very lucky to have been part of his last class”</li>
                            <li class=spacedList>"Ben is an incredible instructor (and person)! He explains concepts in depth and is kind, smart, and fun. Highly recommend!"</li>
                            <li class=spacedList>"Ben is a wonderful instructor who is extremely approachable and knowledgeable. He encouraged everyone so much and taught us interesting and applicable CS topics on things like cybersecurity, sentiment analysis, and climate change."</li>
                            <li class=spacedList>"Ben is just an incredible teacher and puts in the effort to make every class fun and amazing."</li>
                            <li class=spacedList>"If you're on the fence about this course at all, hop off the fence and take this course. This course is getting me more interested in CS than I have been before and made it seem more approachable and more like something that someone who doesn't have the strongest CS background could do. It made the concepts seem real and not just something far off in the distance that I couldn't comprehend. The way that other social issues were effortlessly worked into the course was just wonderful. Ben is a great teacher! Highly recommend, it's a wonderful environment to be in and you're surrounded by very cool people. Great way to end your week (the no homework outside of class is a plus!)."</li>
                            <li class=spacedList>“ben you slayed thank you so much and I hope you know how much you have positively impacted your students <3 thank you CS department for allowing this course to exist" </li>

                            <li class=spacedList>“I learnt everything from Ben. From the basics to the more advanced concepts required for completing the assignments. I learnt good practices to avoid mistakes when writing code. Ben is literally the best! I always feel so supported and Ben dedicates so much time and energy into us!”</li>
                            <li class=spacedList>“Ben always spent so much time and effort helping us, even when it was super late at night and there were so many kids at office hours…Our class got really close because of him…I really loved how perceptive the teaching team (especially Ben) was; they were willing to be flexible with deadlines and modify plans based on student needs and outside factors.  His reviews before the midterm and final were SO helpful!!! He truly encapsulated all the material into a consolidated slideshow which was simple and pleasant to study from”</li>
                            <li class=spacedList>“Ben was the best TA, because he always went above and beyond to help us during office hours - he's super patient and kind and will explain things to you while allowing you to problem-solve for yourself.”</li>
                            <li class=spacedList>“Ben was such an incredibly helpful TA, and he was always there for us when we needed help, even adding office hours. He can very quickly spot problems and realize what we need to fix, and he is able to guide us in the right direction without spoiling the answer”</li>
                            <li class=spacedList>“I would say I benefited the most in 106AX by going to Ben's office hours. He is super understanding and patient, and was willing to explain programming concepts and decomposition methods again and again until I fully understood. Ben and the section leaders are also very encouraging, and I think over time I also became more confident in programming (mindset-wise)—which isn't something that is often talked about but is quite crucial and meaningful for beginner programmers. I'm really grateful for this!”</li>
                            <li class=spacedList>“Ben is literally goated. He puts so much time into the slides and material for the class and cares so much about the students (and the SLs). Love Ben!” </li>
